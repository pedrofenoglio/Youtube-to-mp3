# Youtube-to-mp3
A simple Python script to download songs directly from Youtube

The dependencies used in this script are pytube, os and sys.
pytube : Used to filter audio only (Could adapt the script to download other formats), 
Os and Sys: Used to download the file

The practicity lays in not having to wait for servers, ads, and other annoying things that come with downloading songs from on line converters.
